## What is Codex?

Codex is a _new_ kind of web-based markdown editor, for developers. 🎉

_What makes Codex different?_

Codex is different than other editors because:

1. Codex is a WYSIWYG-like editor, so you can immediately _feel_ your content.
2. Codex is based on web technologies, notably CSS for design. In the near future, you’ll be able to toggle dark mode, import custom themes, including fonts, and tweak your Codex’s stylesheet to your liking. 👌
3. Codex is _for_ developers. A lot of editors are designed for non-technical users, leaving developers to use code editors to achieve the same effect. Codex, however, is designed to replace your code editor for words _and_ code.

## Can I try Codex?

**Yes!** The editor alpha is live at https://opencodex.dev and syncs to localStorage.

You can play with the alpha _now_ — I’m planning to ship the markdown-complete version in the next weeks.

If all goes well, the developer community will soon have a Gist-like platform to easily read, write, and share markdown on the web. Stay tuned! 😀

## Is Codex based on GFM or CommonMark?

Codex is based on CommonMark but is being designed to be interoperable with GFM (GitHub flavored markdown) where reasonable. The reason I’m prioritizing CommonMark is because it’s an easier, smaller subset of GFM.

## How can I help?

By far the _most_ useful thing you can do is _tell me what you dislike_. The more clear your feedback is, the more I can improve Codex for everyone else; don’t hesitate to share your feedback!

You can DM me on Twitter https://twitter.com/username_ZAYDEK or email me at zaydekdotcom [at] gmail [dot] com.

You can of course file an issue and submit a pull request. ❤️

## Is Codex open source?

You may be surprised to learn Codex is MIT open source. Why? Building an editor is _hard_ and the more companies build products based on hard-to-learn technologies in the general domain, the better for the world.
